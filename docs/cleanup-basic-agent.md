# Basic Agent Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

The placeholder `basic` agent example has been removed and all documentation has been updated to reflect that `search_research` is now the primary agent example.

   - Updated directory structure
   - Enhanced search_research description

2. **examples/README.md**
   - Removed basic agent from agent examples
   - Updated search_research as the primary example
   - Removed basic agent from running instructions

3. **examples/agents/README.md**
   - Removed basic agent section
   - Expanded search_research as the complete example

## Current State

The `search_research` agent now serves as the primary example for:

- CLI interface patterns
- Tool integration
- Multiple output format support
- Provider configuration
- Best practices for agent implementation

This provides a more realistic and useful example for developers building their own agents.
